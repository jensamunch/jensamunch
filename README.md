## Quick overview

Since 2007 I've worked in technology as a entrepreneur, strategist, and investor. 

Notable achievements during that time: 
- ðŸ’µ Launching Google Shopping in the UK with 60% of total E-commerce
- ðŸ§  Leading strategy as CSO at iZettle from Series B to E ($150 million raised and $2.2 billion exit) [C]
- ðŸ”¨ Founding Pace Revenue, an AI company, in 2016 and scaling to $8M ARR and 70 employees.

A long time ago I studied PPE at Oxford University and Philosophy at the American University of Beirut. Today I live with my family in London, and am  incubating several new projects.
